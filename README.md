# Coursera Projects Repository
-----------------------------------
Welcome to the "coursera-projects" repository! In this repository, you will find a collection of Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) projects that I have completed as part of various courses on Coursera. Each project is a practical implementation of the concepts learned in the respective courses, showcasing my skills in applying ML and DL techniques to real-world problems.
